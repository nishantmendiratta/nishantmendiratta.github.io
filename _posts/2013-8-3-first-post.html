<p>
	I have created this blog to save some money as it's based on <b>Jekyll Framework</b>.
	This is very efficient in terms of speed and cost effective as compared to content management 
	systems.
</p>

<p>
	I am not a good writer apparently, I like to design and develop the website. I've designed this website on my own ,it's responsive.If you want to create a blog inspired by this design you can easily clone my template from the <b>GIT</b> link provided in footer.
	Keep on cloning and updating this repository.
</p>

<p>
	Visit everyday and learn new things..
