	<b>Hello</b>,
	<br />
	This application is based on an idea of getting information of all blood donors across the nation .
	<br />
	The main motive is to create a link between the donors and the receivers.
	<br />
	This is just a beginning , If you are interested in donating blood to needy ones then register your self with bloodconnection .
	<br />
	Your information will not be secured as this is the only information which will help the needy ones. 
</p>
<p>
	Our Facebook Application <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/bloodconnection" target="_blank">http://apps.facebook.com/bloodconnection</a> is also available for those who don't have an android phone.
